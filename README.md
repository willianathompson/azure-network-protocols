<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>
In this tutorial, we observe various network traffic to and from Azure Virtual Machines with Wireshark as well as experiment with Network Security Groups. <br />


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Various Command-Line Tools
- Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDH, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (22H2)
- Ubuntu Server 20.04

<h2>High-Level Steps</h2>

- Deployment and Configuration of Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)
- Configuration of Network Security Groups (NSGs)
- Traffic Inspection and Analysis with Wireshark
- Evaluation and Adjustment of NSG Rules
- Traffic Generation Between VMs


<h2>Actions and Observations</h2>

<p>
<h4>Deployment and Configuration of Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)</h4>

<p>
</p>
Deploy an Azure VM running Ubuntu Server 20.04 and configure SSH for secure access.

</p>
Deploy a second Azure VM running Windows 10 (22H2), ensuring it is on the same virtual network as the Ubuntu server to allow easy communication between the VMs. Remote Desktop (RDP) is set up on the Windows 10 VM.

<h4>Configuration of Network Security Groups (NSGs)</h4>

</p>
<p>
Network Security Groups (NSGs) are used to control the incoming and outgoing traffic for both VMs. Rules are set up for different types of connections, like SSH, RDP, DNS, and ICMP, to make sure only the right kinds of access are allowed based on the security needs. These NSGs are applied to each VMâ€™s network interface to protect their traffic.

<h4>Traffic Inspection and Analysis with Wireshark</h4>

</p>
<p>
Wireshark was downloaded to watch and analyze the network traffic between the Windows 10 and Ubuntu Server VMs. Traffic was sent between the VMs to check if the connection was working and if the security settings were set up properly. RDP was used to connect to the Windows 10 VM from the Ubuntu VM.

</p>
<p>
A perpetual ping was used to constantly test the ICMP traffic between the VMs, with the network packets being checked to make sure the ping messages were sent and received correctly. The Network Security Group (NSG) rules were also tested to ensure the security settings were controlling the traffic as expected.

</p>
<p>

SSH traffic was observed in Wireshark by running simple commands on the Ubuntu VM, such as id, ls, and hostname. These commands were sent over the network to the Windows 10 VM, and the resulting packets were captured and analyzed to ensure the SSH connection was secure and the traffic was flowing correctly between the VMs.

<p>
A simple script was run to watch the DHCP process, capturing the steps of release, discover, offer, request, and acknowledge messages. DNS was tested by checking if disney.com could be resolved, and the traffic was observed in Wireshark to make sure it worked properly. Also, RDP traffic was monitored to confirm that remote desktop connections were working correctly between the VMs.
